# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Project Overview

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a React application designed to help users, especially those learning or reviewing computer science concepts, visualize and understand various sorting algorithms. The project leverages JavaScript and React to create dynamic and interactive visualizations of how sorting algorithms work step-by-step. This tool is not only useful for memorizing algorithms but also for gaining a deeper understanding of how they function.

## Features

- **Visualization of Sorting Algorithms**: The application currently supports visualizing several sorting algorithms, with more planned for future updates.
- **React-Based Interface**: The application is built using React, providing a modern and responsive user interface.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for students and professionals who want to review or learn sorting algorithms through visual means.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

- **[Algorithm Name]**: A brief description of the algorithm (e.g., Merge Sort - a divide and conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves).

### Planned Features

- **Quicksort**: A fast, in-place, divide and conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple, intuitive algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time, placing each element in its correct position.
- **Binary Tree Visualization**: A potential future feature that will help visualize binary tree structures and operations.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for algorithm logic and visualization.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the application and creating visual effects.

## File Structure

- **/src/Algorithms**: Contains the JavaScript files implementing the sorting algorithms.
- **/src/Visualizer**: Contains the components responsible for rendering the visualizations.
- **App.js**: The main application component that integrates the visualizer and algorithms.
- **index.js**: The entry point of the React application.
